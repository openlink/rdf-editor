Workspaces.  Workspaces are place where data is stored and asscoiated prolices of privacy.
A given application typically stores information in several different
workspaces, some being user private, some shared, and some public.
it is crucial that the user has easy control over the destiny of information.

Goals then are that the user can

      - create workspaces
      - easily understand which workspace data is going into
      - understand what the implications of that are
      - (later) set ACLS on them
      - publish apropriate use policies for them
